      <p class="description">  Red beans and rice is an emblematic dish of Louisiana Creole cuisine (not originally of Cajun cuisine) traditionally made on Mondays with red beans,[1] vegetables (bell pepper, onion, and celery), spices (thyme, cayenne pepper, and bay leaf) and pork bones as left over from Sunday dinner, cooked together slowly in a pot and served over rice.[2] Meats such as ham, sausage (most commonly andouille), and tasso ham are also frequently used in the dish. The dish is customary – ham was traditionally a Sunday meal and Monday was washday. A pot of beans could sit on the stove and simmer while the women were busy scrubbing clothes. The dish is now fairly common throughout the Southeast. Similar dishes are common in Latin American cuisine, including moros y cristianos, gallo pinto and feijoada.

Red beans and rice is one of the few New Orleans style dishes to be commonly served both in people's homes and in restaurants. Many neighborhood restaurants and even schools continue to serve it as a Monday lunch or dinner special, usually with a side order of cornbread and either smoked sausage or a pork chop. While Monday washdays are largely a thing of the past, red beans remain a staple for large gatherings such as Super Bowl and Mardi Gras parties. Indeed, red beans and rice is very much part of the New Orleans identity. New Orleanian Louis Armstrong's favorite food was red beans and rice – the musician would sign letters "Red Beans and Ricely Yours, Louis Armstrong".[3] And in 1965, the R&B instrumental group Booker T. & the M.G.'s wrote and recorded a song titled "Red Beans and Rice" that was originally a B-side but later became popular in its own right.

The vegetarian dish Rajma chawal[4] is very similar (which translates literally to red beans and rice), popular in North India. Red beans and rice is also a dietary staple in Central America, where it is known as "arroz con habichuelas". The dish is popular in Cuban, Puerto Rican, Dominican, Haitian and Jamaican cuisine as well.Rājmā[1] or Rāzmā is a popular vegetarian dish, originating from the Indian subcontinent, consisting of red kidney beans in a thick gravy with many Indian whole spices, and is usually served with rice. Although kidney beans did not originate from the Indian subcontinent, it is a part of regular diet in Northern India. The dish developed after the red kidney bean was brought to the Indian subcontinent from Mexico.[2] A 100 gram serving of boiled Rajma beans contains about 140 calories, 5.7 grams of protein, 5.9 grams of fat and 18 grams of carbohydrate.[2] Rajma chawal is kidney beans served with boiled rice.

Some of the best Rajma is said to be grown in the north Indian state of Himachal Pradesh and the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir. Rajma chawal served with chutney of Anardana is the famous dish of Peerah, a town in Ramban district of Jammu & Kashmir, and assar in doda district of Jammu & Kashmir. Going further, the Rajma of Chinta Valley in Doda district, a short distance from the town of Bhaderwah of Jammu province are said to be amongst the most popular. These are smaller in size than most Rajma grown in plains and have a slightly sweetish taste.

The combination of Rajma and rice generally lists as a top favorite of North Indians and Nepalis.[3] Rajma is prepared with onion, garlic and many spices in India, and it is one of the staple foods in Nepal.

Rajma Masala is a very popular dish in the Northern states of India. The Punjabi way of cooking Rajma Masala is to soak it overnight in water, boil it using a pressure cooker and mix bhuna masala made with chopped onions, pureed tomato, ginger, garlic and milieu of fresh spices including cumin, coriander and chilli powder.[4]

Rajma boti chawal was a very popular staple food of southern parts in Orrisa, it was consumed by "aam aadmi" (working class people).

Rajma is spoken as a masculine word with pronouns indicating as such.Step 1 Soak rajma overnight and pressure cook till they are soft
Wash the rajma and allow it to soak in water overnight. Wash it again and pressure cook with 2 cups of water, salt and turmeric. Once the rajma is soft and squishy remove it from fire and keep it aside.

Step 2 Chop onion-tomato and make ginger-garlic paste
Finely chop onions and keep aside, grate the tomatoes and keep them aside. Make a paste of ginger, garlic and green chillies.

Step 3 Prepare the rajma
In a deep bottomed pan, add mustard oil, when it gets heated add green cardamom, black cardamom, cinnamon, clove, peppercorn. Once they become fragrant, add onions and cook till they are golden brown. Now add the tomatoes and cook on high for 4-5 minutes. Add ginger- garlic-chilli paste, cumin powder, coriander powder and black pepper powder. Cook till the spices become fragrant and oil starts leaving the sides of the pan. Now add the rajma and one cup of water. Mix well and cook covered for 10 minutes. Once done, add the ghee. You can garnish with coriander leaves. Your rajma is ready.

Step 4 Steam cook rice and serve with Rajma
To make steamed rice without using a pressure cooker, wash 1 cup rice in running water. Then, add them in a large and deep-bottomed pan with 4-5 cups of water in it. You can also add a little salt in it for taste. Once the rice is soft and double its size, strain the water. Spread the rice on a plate and allow it to air for 2-3 minutes. Once the rice is done, serve hot with prepared Rajma
